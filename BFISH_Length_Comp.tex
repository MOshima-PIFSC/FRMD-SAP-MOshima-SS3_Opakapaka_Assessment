\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the Big Island, catches were pretty consistent between 2017-2019
  but 2016 was very different, probably because n = 3. Also, depth was
  more in the mid-range of sampled depths. They did not sample in the
  shallower range, unlike other years.\\
\item
  Kauai only had 2 years of data (2016 n = 24, and 2019 n = 15) and the
  distributions were different, 2016 had mostly smaller fish whereas
  2019 had more larger fish.\\
\item
  Maui Nui catches all had the same mode for larger sizes (between 40 -
  70 cm) but the modes for the smaller sized fish fluctuated each
  year.\\
\item
  Niihau had very small sample sizes (n = 2 - 5) for the 3 years
  sampling occurred there so distributions are not that reliable but
  size range is fairly consistent. Also, the distributions are
  consistent with the 2019 lengths in Kauai (support for combining those
  regions?).\\
\item
  Oahu had consistent length distributions for 2017 and 2018 but 2019
  was almost exclusively small fish (\textless{} 20 cm, n = 67)

  (n = 2) and Maui Nui (n = 10) were similar.\\
\item
  In 2017, mostly smaller fish caught off Big Island compared to the
  other islands.
\item
  In 2018, there is a bimodal distribution for Maui Nui and less
  pronouced for the Big Island. Oahu has only larger fish
  (\textgreater{} 40 cm).\\
\item
  In 2019, the first mode is almost exclusively from Oahu samples, the
  second mode is from Big Island and Maui Nui samples, and the third
  mode is from all islands.
